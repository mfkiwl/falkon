/*
 * Copy the triangular part of a 2D tensor, to the opposite triangle. Makes the input tensor symmetric.
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * A
 *     The input 2D tensor. `A` must be a square CUDA tensor.
 * upper
 *     Keyword used to select the 'origin' triangle for the copy. If `upper` is true,
 *     the upper triangle will be copied to the lower triangle; if `upper is false,
 *     the lower triangle will be copied to the upper triangle.
 *
 * Returns
 * -------
 * A
 *     A tensor which shares the same memory as the input.

/*
 * Multiply a triangular portion of a square tensor by a scalar.
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * A
 *     The input 2D tensor. `A` must be a square CUDA tensor.
 * upper
 *     Selects the triangular portion of the matrix which will be modified.
 * preserve_diag
 *     Whether the diagonal of the input should be left as is. If `preserve_diag` is false,
 *     the diagonal will be multiplied as well.
 * multiplier
 *     The scalar by which the triangle will be multiplied. Set this to 0 if you
 *     want to clear the triangular portion.
 *
 * Returns
 * -------
 * A
 *     A tensor which shares the same memory as the input.
